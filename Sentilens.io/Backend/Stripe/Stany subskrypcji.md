| `trialing`           | The subscription is currently in a trial period and you can safely provision your product for your customer. The subscription transitions automatically to `active` when a customer makes the first payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `active`             | The subscription is in good standing. For `past_due` subscriptions, paying the latest associated invoice or marking it uncollectible transitions the subscription to `active`. Note that `active` doesn’t indicate that all outstanding invoices associated with the subscription have been paid. You can leave other outstanding invoices open for payment, mark them as uncollectible, or void them as you see fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `incomplete`         | The customer must make a successful payment within 23 hours to activate the subscription. Or the payment [requires action](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action), such as customer authentication. Subscriptions can also be `incomplete` if there’s a pending payment and the PaymentIntent status is `processing`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `incomplete_expired` | The initial payment on the subscription failed and the customer didn’t make a successful payment within 23 hours of subscription creation. These subscriptions don’t bill customers. This status exists so you can track customers that failed to activate their subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `past_due`           | Payment on the latest _finalized_ invoice either failed or wasn’t attempted. The subscription continues to create invoices. Your Dashboard [subscription settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) determine the subscription’s next status. If the invoice is still unpaid after all attempted [smart retries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries), you can configure the subscription to move to `canceled`, `unpaid`, or leave it as `past_due`. To reactivate the subscription, have your customer pay the most recent invoice. The subscription status becomes `active` regardless of whether the payment is done before or after the latest invoice due date. |
| `canceled`           | The subscription was canceled. During cancellation, automatic collection for all unpaid invoices is disabled (`auto_advance=false`). This is a terminal state that can’t be updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `unpaid`             | The latest invoice hasn’t been paid but the subscription remains in place. The latest invoice remains open and invoices continue to generate, but payments aren’t attempted. Revoke access to your product when the subscription is `unpaid` because payments were already attempted and retried while `past_due`. To move the subscription to `active`, pay the most recent invoice before its due date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `paused`             | The subscription has ended its trial period without a default payment method and the [trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment) is set to `pause`. Invoices are no longer created for the subscription. After attaching a default payment method to the customer, you can [resume the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#resume-a-paused-subscription).                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
